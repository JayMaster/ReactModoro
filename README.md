# ReactModoro
My work on Tyler McGinnis' course on React Native.

Since the Navigation Tyler uses is deprecated, I decided to learn the newer react-navigation on my own and integrate it into the course.
Even though this has proven to be quite difficult sometimes, I believe this will improve my skills.
The implementation of the Navigation itself turned out to be quite easy in retrospect, but the combination of Redux (which I am completely now to) and the react-navigation (which I haven't completely grasped, either) was a pain in the ass. That's why I'm really happy that I somehow managed to do that, even though I don't understand everything about it yet, to be honest.
